#Pseudo Code for Algorithm 3:-

Loop through each student in the student list.
Display a message asking the user to enter the minimum score to filter students.
Use the input threshold to call the showStudentsBelowScore(threshold) method.
For each student, check if their score is less than the provided threshold.
If the student’s score is below the threshold, print or store the student’s details.
If no students have scores below the threshold, display an appropriate message.





#Pseudo Code for Algorithm 4:-

Evaluate whether the user's input (option) equals 3.
Print the message "Goodbye!" to inform the user that the program is about to terminate.
Use the break statement to exit the loop, which effectively stops the program from continuing any further operations.
